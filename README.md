# WPEC-to-Woocommerce-attributes-converter
This script will convert WPSC product attributes (inserted with WP e-Commerce - Custom Fields Plugin) to WOOCOMMERCE product attributes. Load this file in your theme folder, then create a new page from WP admin panel and select 'Script' as template, then load that page.  This is ONLY to import the custom WPEC attributes, not the rest.  Run it at your own risk, I made it for my own purposes...and it works.
